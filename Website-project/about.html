          >The Strawberry</a
        >
      </b>
      is one of my favourite fruits mainly because it is a very good tasting
      strawberry that are great to eat during a hot summer day. This red fruit
      also has many other benifits other than tasting good, such as They
      naturally deliver vitamins, fiber, and particularly high levels of
      antioxidants known as polyphenols - without any sodium, fat, or
      cholesterol which is really good for our bodies.

          >The Orange</a
        >
      </b>
      is another one of my favourite fruits mainly because how refreshing it
      taste like. It might be a pain to peal it but when your done its
      definetley worth it. Some other benifits of eating this orange fruit are
      that it helps normalize bowel movements, lowers cholesterol levels,
      controls blood sugar, maintains bowel health, and aids in achieving a
      healthy weight. Most importantly the oranges have a signicant amount of
      vitamin C so eating this will help with your vitamin intake.

          >The Raspberry</a
        ></b
      >
      is another one of my favoruite fruit not only because of its refreshing
      taste but of the amazing snack it becomes when it is frozen. When you
      freeze it becomes cold and is great to have during a hot day. Some other
      benifits of this red fruit are that they provide potassium, essential to
      heart function, and proven to lower blood pressure.
